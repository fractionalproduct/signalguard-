# Project Status

> Quick "where are we" snapshot so any session can resume instantly.
> Last updated: 2026-06-15 (M2 auth shell — login + 2FA — brought current with main; awaiting owner Vercel steps).

## 🔭 Active right now (Milestone 2 — Authentication)

- ✅ Auth engine (`@signalguard/auth`): scrypt passwords, RFC-6238 TOTP, recovery
  codes, AES-256-GCM encryption — merged.
- ✅ Auth DB schema (`Session`, `RecoveryCode`, `PasswordResetToken`, Owner MFA
  fields) — applied to Supabase + merged.
- ✅ Owner account created via `pnpm create-owner` (prazmanb@gmail.com).
- 🔀 **Login page** — branch `milestone-2/login`: /login form, Prisma-backed
  sessions (HTTP-only cookie + hash), (dashboard) route group with auth guard,
  edge middleware, logout. Being deployed (lockfile fixed; Vercel needs Build
  Command override `cd ../.. && pnpm --filter "@signalguard/web..." build` + env
  var `DATABASE_URL`).
- 🔀 **Two-factor (2FA)** — branch `milestone-2/mfa` (built on top of login):
  - Settings → Security page: QR-code enrollment (uses `qrcode` dep) + recovery
    codes shown once.
  - Two-step login: password → `/login/mfa` (TOTP or recovery code) → session.
  - TOTP secret stored encrypted (needs **`ENCRYPTION_KEY`** env var on Vercel,
    32-byte base64/hex — generate: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"`).
  - **Merge order: login first, then mfa.** Needs build verification.

## ⏭️ Remaining in Milestone 2
- Password reset flow. Optional: force MFA enrollment on first login.

## ✅ Done

- **Milestone 0** — repository & cloud-readiness foundation (docs, dev container, CI).
- **Milestone 1** — monorepo foundation, **deployed and running in the cloud**:
  - 🌐 **Web portal** → Vercel (live; shows PAPER TRADING banner + `/api/health`)
  - 🗄️ **Database** → Supabase (`Owner` + `AuditEvent` tables, RLS locked)
  - ⚙️ **General worker** → Railway (always-on, green)
  - 🔒 **Trading worker** → Railway (always-on, green; paper-mode guard active)
  - All four run independently of the owner's laptop.
- **Owner account creation** (`pnpm create-owner`) — merged to `main` (M2c).
- **Verified + merged to `main`** (each: builds + tests pass, lockfile regenerated with pnpm 9.12.0):
  - `@signalguard/risk-engine` — deterministic risk engine (AGENTS.md §10). **Safety-critical;
    rule logic reviewed against §10:** all 26 block codes present, conservative boundary operators
    (loss limits block at `>=`), reports every triggered block, pure function. 3/3 tests pass.
  - `@signalguard/position-sizing` — pure position sizing (smallest cap wins; long-only). 8/8 tests.
  - `@signalguard/broker-adapters` — **read-only** Alpaca **paper** client (no order submission;
    refuses live endpoint + non-paper `TRADING_MODE`). 5/5 tests.
  - `@signalguard/performance` — performance package (merged via the overnight integration batch).
  - `pnpm reset-password` CLI — resets owner password + revokes all sessions.

## 🟢 Built overnight, awaiting owner merge to `main`

> Merging to `main` is owner-only (AGENTS.md). Both are pushed to origin and verified.

- **`milestone-4/agent-foundation`** — `@signalguard/agent-core` (v0.1.0): deterministic
  scaffolding every agent runs on (AgentRegistry, PromptRegistry, AgentToolGateway,
  HumanReviewQueue, AgentOrchestrator). No live LLM/DB — executor + audit sink injected, so the
  whole pipeline is unit-testable. Permissions enforced in code, model output always re-validated.
  **22/22 tests green; full `pnpm -r` gate passes.** 1 ahead, 0 behind `main` — ready to merge.
- **`milestone-3/portfolio-dashboard`** — read-only portfolio dashboard on the paper broker
  adapter (pure `money`/`portfolio-view` libs, server-only loader, presentational UI). Verified.
  1 ahead, **2 behind `main`** — rebase/merge `main` before merging.

## 🚧 In progress — Milestone 2 (Auth & UX shell)

- **`milestone-2/login`** — login page, DB-backed sessions, `(dashboard)` route guard, logout.
  Code verified locally (build + typecheck + tests green). **Blocked on owner Vercel steps**
  (Build Command override + `DATABASE_URL`), then merge → production.
- **`milestone-2/mfa`** — TOTP 2FA + recovery codes (built on top of login). Code verified
  (build + tests green). Needs Vercel env var **`ENCRYPTION_KEY`** before its production deploy.

## ▶️ Next

- Owner: merge M3 + M4 to `main`; complete the Vercel steps to unblock M2 login/MFA deploys.

## 💵 Cost

- ~**$5/month** (Railway, after free trial). Vercel + Supabase free. AI usage added at later milestones.

## 🔌 Services & wiring notes

- Supabase: connection strings (Connect → ORM tab) live in the owner's password manager.
  `DATABASE_URL` = pooled (6543, pgbouncer), `DIRECT_URL` = direct (5432). Add `DATABASE_URL`
  to Vercel for the login deploy.
- Vercel build command override (monorepo): `cd ../.. && pnpm --filter "@signalguard/web..." build`.
- Upstash (Redis) account exists; not wired yet (used when worker queues come online).
- Alpaca paper account: needed when the read-only dashboard goes live (M3). AI provider: M4.
